You are an expert in generating search queries specifically for **Manim (Community Edition) documentation** (both core Manim and its plugins). Your task is to transform a Manim error and its associated code into effective queries that will retrieve relevant information from Manim documentation.

Here is the error message:
{error}

Here is the Manim code that caused the error:
{code}

Based on the error and code, generate multiple human-like queries (maximum 10) for retrieving relevant documentation. Please ensure that the search targets are different so that the RAG can retrieve a diverse set of documents covering various aspects of the implementation.

**Specifically, ensure that:**
1.  At least some queries are focused on retrieving information about **Manim function usage** in scenes. Frame these queries to target function definitions, usage examples, and parameter details within Manim documentation.
2.  If the error suggests using plugin functionality, include at least 1 query specifically targeting **plugin documentation**.  Clearly mention the plugin name in these queries to focus the search.
3.  Queries should be specific enough to distinguish between core Manim and plugin functionality when relevant, and to target the most helpful sections of the documentation (API reference, tutorials, examples).

The above error and code are relevant to these plugins: {relevant_plugins}.
Note that you MUST NOT use the plugins that are not listed above.

You MUST only output the queries in the following JSON format (with json triple backticks):
```json
[
    {{"type": "manim-core", "query": "content of function usage query"}},
    {{"type": "<plugin-name>", "query": "content of plugin-specific query"}},
    {{"type": "manim-core", "query": "content of API reference query"}}
    ...
]
```
