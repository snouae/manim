[ANIMATION_STRATEGY]
1. **Pedagogical Animation Plan:**
    - **Sub-scene 1: Equation Reveal (Foundational Setup)**
        - `Write(equation)` with run_time=1.5
        - **Rationale:** Progressive reveal prevents cognitive overload. Stroke-by-stroke writing mimics natural note-taking, helping learners mentally prepare for equation analysis.
    - **Sub-scene 2: Square Connections (Visual-Semantic Mapping)**
        - `FadeIn(square_group)` simultaneously (run_time=1.5)
        - Sequential `Create(arrows)` with 0.3s delays (run_time=0.7 each)
        - **Rationale:** Simultaneous square appearance establishes term grouping, while staggered arrow creation directs sequential attention to a²→b²→c² relationships observed in Scene 2.
    - **Sub-scene 3: Algebraic Derivation (Conceptual Bridge)**
        - `Circumscribe(left_side)` (run_time=2) → `Transform(left_side)` (run_time=1) → `Indicate(right_side)` (run_time=1)
        - **Rationale:** Yellow highlight focuses attention on combined terms before transformation to c², demonstrating equation equivalence through visual metamorphosis rather than abstract substitution.
    - **Sub-scene 4: Final Emphasis (Cognitive Anchoring)**
        - `Create(rect)` + `Flash()` (run_time=2) with simultaneous `FadeOut(arrows,squares)` (run_time=1.5)
        - **Rationale:** Golden border creates visual prominence while fading auxiliary elements prevents distraction from core equation.

2. **Scene Flow - Pedagogical Pacing and Clarity:**
    - **Spatial Progression:**
        1. Central equation establishes hierarchy
        2. Squares descend to create vertical information flow
        3. Arrows bridge abstract/concrete representations
        4. Derivation animates within equation space
    - **Transition Buffers:**
        - 0.5s after equation reveal: Allows pattern recognition
        - 1s after arrows: Facilitates term-square mapping
        - 2s during derivation: Gives time for mental algebra
    - **Narration Sync:**
        - Equation writing completes with "fundamental relationship"
        - Arrow creation aligns with "correspond directly"
        - Transformation coincides with "algebraic equivalence"

[NARRATION]
**Pedagogical Narration Script:**
[00:00] "Building on the geometric proof we saw earlier, let's now translate those visual insights into mathematical language. [Equation begins writing] At the heart of this relationship lies a simple yet profound equation... [Equation completes] a² plus b² equals c²."

[00:06] [0.5s pause] "Notice how each term corresponds directly to the colored squares from our geometric proof. [First arrow appears] The blue a² represents the area of this square on the shorter side... [Second arrow] The green b² captures the other leg's contribution... [Third arrow] While the red c² encompasses the hypotenuse's square."

[00:12] [1s pause] "Let's make this connection explicit. [Left side circles] The combination of a² and b²... [Transformation occurs] through geometric equivalence we established, must equal... [Right side flashes] this single c² term. The equation condenses spatial truth into algebraic form."

[00:18] "And there we have it - [golden border appears] this elegant equation a² + b² = c² becomes our universal tool for relating a right triangle's sides. Hold onto this formula - in our next scenes, we'll explore its powerful applications."

**Narration Sync - Pedagogical Alignment:**
- Equation writing starts at "translate those visual insights" - creates parallel between verbal metaphor and visual development
- Arrow explanations are timed to individual arrow creations (0.3s offset for speech processing)
- "Through geometric equivalence" coincides with transformation animation
- "Universal tool" aligns with golden border flash for emotional emphasis
