# Task: Video Frame Quality Evaluation

You are tasked with analyzing and scoring a frame taken from a theorem explanation video. Note that you may not have the context of the video, so the captured frame may be a frame where some motion of visual elements is taking place. Your job is to assign a score from 1 to 5 for each criterion. Please provide a brief justification for your scores.

## Evaluation Criteria

1. **Visual Relevance**
   - Does the video frame align with the theorem's concepts and derivations?

2. **Element Layout**
   - Placemend and Size: Are the visual elements well-placed and appropriately sized within the frame?
   - Overlap: Are the visual elements free of unintentional overlap?
   - Clarity: Is the visual information conveyed in the frame clear and easy to understand?

## Scoring Instructions
1. Assign a score from **1 to 5** for each dimension:
   - **1**: Very poor quality, completely fails to meet the criteria.
   - **2**: Below average, significant issues present.
   - **3**: Acceptable, meets the basic criteria with minor issues.
   - **4**: Good, performs well with no major issues.
   - **5**: Excellent, fully meets or exceeds expectations.
2. Provide a comprehensive evaluation for each dimension.
3. Format your output in **JSON**

### JSON Output Format
