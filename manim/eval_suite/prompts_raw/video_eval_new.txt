# Task: Video Frame Quality Evaluation

You are tasked with analyzing and scoring a chunk of a theorem explanation video. Note that you may not have the full context of the video. Your job is to assign a score from 1 to 5 for each criterion. Please provide a brief justification for your scores.

## Evaluation Criteria

1. **Visual Consistency**
   - Style Consistency: Does the visual style remain consistent across frames?
   - Smoothness: Are the motions and transitions smooth?

## Scoring Instructions
1. Assign a score from **1 to 5** for each dimension:
   - **1**: Very poor quality, completely fails to meet the criteria.
   - **2**: Below average, significant issues present.
   - **3**: Acceptable, meets the basic criteria with minor issues.
   - **4**: Good, performs well with no major issues.
   - **5**: Excellent, fully meets or exceeds expectations.
2. Provide a comprehensive evaluation for each dimension.
3. Format your output in **JSON**

### JSON Output Format
```json
{{
  "overall_analysis": "[Provide a general assessment of the video's quality]",
  "evaluation": {{
    "visual_consistency": {{
      "comprehensive_evaluation": "[Analysis of visual consistency]",
