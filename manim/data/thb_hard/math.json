Then the number of distinct orbits of X under the action of G is given by:\n\n(1/|G|) * \u03a3 |Fix(g)|\n\nwhere |G| is the order of the group (i.e., the number of elements in G), the sum is taken over all elements g in G, and |Fix(g)| is the number of elements in X that are fixed by the action of g (i.e., the number of elements x in X such that g(x) = x).\n\nIn simpler terms, Burnside's Lemma states that the number of distinct orbits (or equivalence classes) in a set under the action of a group can be found by averaging the number of fixed points of each group element.\n\nBurnside's Lemma is often used in combinatorial problems where we need to count the number of distinct configurations of an object, taking into account its symmetries. By applying the lemma, we can avoid overcounting configurations that are equivalent under a given symmetry operation.",
