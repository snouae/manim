        "theorem": "Properties of Kites",
        "description": "A kite is a quadrilateral with two pairs of adjacent, congruent sides. In geometry, kites have several unique properties that distinguish them from other quadrilaterals. Here are some of the key properties of kites:\n\n1. Two pairs of adjacent sides are congruent: In a kite, there are two distinct pairs of adjacent sides that have equal length. This means that if one pair of sides has a length of 'a', the other pair will also have a length of 'a', and if the other pair has a length of 'b', the first pair will also have a length of 'b'.\n\n2. Diagonals are perpendicular: The diagonals of a kite intersect at a 90-degree angle, meaning they are perpendicular to each other.\n\n3. One diagonal is bisected: In a kite, one of the diagonals is bisected by the other diagonal, meaning it is divided into two equal parts. This property is true for the diagonal connecting the vertices between the congruent sides.\n\n4. One pair of opposite angles is congruent: In a kite, the angles between the congruent sides (the angles formed by the two pairs of equal sides) are congruent, meaning they have the same degree measure.\n\n5. Area: The area of a kite can be calculated using the lengths of its diagonals. If 'd1' and 'd2' are the lengths of the diagonals, the area of the kite is given by the formula: Area = (1/2) * d1 * d2.\n\n6. Circumscribed circle: A kite can have a circumscribed circle only if it is a rhombus (all sides are congruent) or a square (all sides and angles are congruent).\n\n7. Inscribed circle: A kite can have an inscribed circle only if it is a square (all sides and angles are congruent).\n\nThese properties make kites an interesting and unique type of quadrilateral in geometry.",

        "theorem": "Euler's formula",
        "description": "Euler's formula is a fundamental equation in complex analysis that establishes a deep connection between trigonometry and complex exponentials. It is named after the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler. The formula is given by:\n\ne^(ix) = cos(x) + i*sin(x)\n\nwhere e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828), i is the imaginary unit (i^2 = -1), x is a real number, and cos(x) and sin(x) are the trigonometric functions cosine and sine, respectively.\n\nEuler's formula demonstrates that complex exponentials can be expressed in terms of trigonometric functions, and vice versa. This relationship is particularly useful in various fields of mathematics, physics, and engineering, as it simplifies calculations involving complex numbers and trigonometric functions.\n\nOne of the most famous consequences of Euler's formula is Euler's identity, which is obtained by setting x = \u03c0 in the formula:\n\ne^(i\u03c0) + 1 = 0\n\nEuler's identity is considered one of the most beautiful equations in mathematics, as it combines five fundamental constants (e, i, \u03c0, 1, and 0) in a simple and elegant relationship.",
