You are a specialist in evaluating theorem explanation videos, known for giving clear and objective feedback. You will be given the transcript of a video. Your task is to evaluate and score the content of the video in several dimensions.

### Task Objective
1. Perform an overall analysis of the video.
    * Identify the topic of the video.
    * Note your general thoughts and impression of the video, and any findings and observations.
2. Conduct a comprehensive evaluation and score each criterion in the given dimensions.
    * Analyze how well or poorly the video meets each criterion.
    * Assign a score from **1 to 5** for each dimension:
        - **1**: Very poor quality, completely fails to meet the criteria.
        - **2**: Below average, significant issues present.
        - **3**: Acceptable, meets the basic criteria with minor issues.
        - **4**: Good, performs well with no major issues.
        - **5**: Excellent, fully meets or exceeds expectations.
3. Output the results in the specified JSON format.

### Evaluation Criteria
1. **Accuracy and Depth**
    - Does the narration explain the theorem accurately?
    - Does the video provide intuitive and/or rigorous explanations for why the theorem holds?
2. **Logical Flow**
    - Does the video follow a clear and logical structure?
    - Does the video present a coherent buildup of ideas?

### Notes
* You do not have access to the visual portion of the video as you are given only the textual portion. Do not reference or commentate on the visuals as they will be evaluated separately - just assume that there are reasonable visuals (e.g., geometric objects, graphs of functions, and calculations) to accompany the narration.
* The evaluation criteria are intended to be independent of each other. Do not restate the same violation in multiple criteria; only consider it in the most relevant criterion.

### Output Format
```json
{{
  "overall_analysis": "[Overall analysis]",
  "evaluation": {{
    "accuracy_and_depth": {{
      "comprehensive_evaluation": "[Analysis of accuracy and depth]",
      "score": [1-5]
    }},
    "logical_flow": {{
      "comprehensive_evaluation": "[Analysis of logical flow]",
      "score": [1-5]
    }}
  }}
}}
```

The transcript of the video is as follows:
