It is named after Sir Isaac Newton and Joseph Raphson, who independently developed the method in the 17th century.\n\nThe method is based on the idea of linear approximation, where a function is approximated by its tangent line at a given point. The intersection of this tangent line with the x-axis provides a better approximation of the root than the initial point. This process is then repeated iteratively until the desired level of accuracy is achieved.\n\nGiven a function f(x) and an initial guess x0 for the root, the Newton-Raphson method can be described by the following iterative formula:\n\nx1 = x0 - f(x0) / f'(x0)\n\nHere, f'(x0) is the derivative of the function f(x) evaluated at the point x0. The new approximation x1 is then used as the starting point for the next iteration, and the process is repeated until the difference between successive approximations is smaller than a predefined tolerance level or a maximum number of iterations is reached.\n\nThe Newton-Raphson method converges rapidly when the initial guess is close to the actual root and the function is well-behaved. However, the method may fail to converge or converge to a wrong root if the initial guess is not close enough to the actual root, or if the function has multiple roots, or if the derivative of the function is zero or nearly zero at the root.\n\nDespite these limitations, the Newton-Raphson method is widely used in various fields of science and engineering due to its simplicity and fast convergence properties when applied to well-behaved functions.",
