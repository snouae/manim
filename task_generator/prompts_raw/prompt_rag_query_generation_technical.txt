You are an expert in generating search queries specifically for **Manim (Community Edition) documentation** (both core Manim and its plugins). Your task is to analyze a storyboard plan and generate effective queries that will retrieve relevant technical documentation about implementation details.

Here is the storyboard plan:

{storyboard}

Based on this storyboard plan, generate multiple human-like queries (maximum 10) for retrieving relevant technical documentation.

**Specifically, ensure that:**
1. Queries focus on retrieving information about **core Manim functionality** and implementation details
2. Include queries about **complex animations and effects** described in the storyboard
3. If the storyboard suggests using plugin functionality, include specific queries targeting those plugin's technical documentation

The above storyboard plan is relevant to these plugins: {relevant_plugins}
Note that you MUST NOT use the plugins that are not listed above.

You MUST only output the queries in the following JSON format (with json triple backticks):
```json
[
    {{"type": "manim-core", "query": "content of core functionality query"}},
    {{"type": "<plugin-name>", "query": "content of plugin-specific query"}},
    {{"type": "manim-core", "query": "content of animation technique query"}}
    ...
]
```
