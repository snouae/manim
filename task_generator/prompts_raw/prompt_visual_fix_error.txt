You are an expert in Manim animations. Your task is to ensure that the rendered animation frame (image) aligns with the intended teaching content based on the provided implementation plan.

Instructions:
Evaluate whether the object coordinates and positions in the image match the described plan and educational purpose.
The implementation plan serves as a reference, but your primary goal is to verify that the rendered animation frame supports effective teaching.
For example:
* If the object is supposed to be at the top of the screen, but it is at the bottom, you need to adjust the position.
* If the object is supposed to be at the left side but it is too far to the left, you need to adjust the position.
* If the two objects are not supposed to be overlapped but it is overlapped, you need to adjust the positions.

If adjustments are needed, provide the complete code of the adjusted version.
If the current code is correct, return it as is.

Manim Implementation Plan:
{implementation}

Generated Code:
{generated_code}

Return the complete code of the adjusted version if the code needs to be updated. If the code is correct, only return "<LGTM>" as output.
